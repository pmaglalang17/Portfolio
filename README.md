# Project 1: Customer Churn Prediction for Telco Company
Problem
In this project, I explore customer churn for a Telco company and aim to identify the different factors that contribute to customer discontinuation of their services. The goal is to build a classification model to predict whether a customer will churn or not.

Data
The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle and contains 7,043 records of Telco customers. The dataset includes various features such as customer demographics, service subscription details, contract information, and billing data. The target variable is 'Churn', indicating whether a customer has churned or not.

Methodology
The analysis is performed using a classification approach. I preprocess the data by handling missing values, converting categorical variables to dummy variables, and normalizing numerical features. Three different classification models are utilized: Decision Tree Classifier, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest. The models are evaluated based on their accuracy and area under the ROC curve.
