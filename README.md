Welcome to my GitHub portfolio! This repository showcases my data science and machine learning projects. Each project is contained in its own folder, and the code, data, and relevant documentation are included within.

# Project 1: Customer Churn Prediction for Telco Company

## Problem:

In this project, I explore customer churn for a Telco company and aim to identify the different factors that contribute to customer discontinuation of their services. The goal is to build a classification model to predict whether a customer will churn or not.

## Data:

The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle and contains 7,043 records of Telco customers. The dataset includes various features such as customer demographics, service subscription details, contract information, and billing data. The target variable is 'Churn', indicating whether a customer has churned or not.

## Methodology:

The analysis is performed using a classification approach. I preprocess the data by handling missing values, converting categorical variables to dummy variables, and normalizing numerical features. Three different classification models are utilized: Decision Tree Classifier, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest. The models are evaluated based on their accuracy and area under the ROC curve.
# Project 2: Customer Database SQL

## Description:

This GitHub repository showcases a database project and SQL queries related to managing a music store. The database includes tables for customers, artists, items (music albums), employees, orders, and order details. The project aims to demonstrate proficiency in SQL database management, querying, and manipulation.

## SQL Queries

The repository contains a series of SQL queries that demonstrate various operations and functionalities of the database:

Retrieving customer names and phone numbers sorted by last name and first name.
Displaying customer names, phone numbers, and fax numbers for customers from specific states.
Listing unique city names where customers reside.
Calculating and displaying sale prices for items with a 25% discount.
Showing customer names and phone numbers for customers with zip codes starting with '4'.
Filtering orders made between specific date ranges and displaying them with formatted order dates.
Displaying orders made on Saturdays and Sundays along with their order dates.
Retrieving customer names and phone numbers for customers who have fax numbers.
Inserting a new item record into the "items" table.
Updating the unit price of a specific item.
Deleting a specific item from the "items" table.
Combining customer last names, first names, and formatting phone numbers in a specific style.

## Usage
You can explore and use this repository to understand SQL database management, querying techniques, and database manipulation.
