Welcome to my GitHub portfolio! This repository showcases my SQL and machine learning project. Each project is contained in its own folder, and the code,  and data, are included within.

# Project 1: Customer Churn Prediction for Telco Company

## Problem:

In this project, I explore customer churn for a Telco company and aim to identify the different factors that contribute to customer discontinuation of their services. The goal is to build a classification model to predict whether a customer will churn or not.

## Data:

The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle and contains 7,043 records of Telco customers. The dataset includes various features such as customer demographics, service subscription details, contract information, and billing data. The target variable is 'Churn', indicating whether a customer has churned or not.

## Methodology:

The analysis is performed using a classification approach. I preprocess the data by handling missing values, converting categorical variables to dummy variables, and normalizing numerical features. Three different classification models are utilized: Decision Tree Classifier, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest. The models are evaluated based on their accuracy and area under the ROC curve.
# Project 2: Customer Database SQL

## Description:

This project showcases SQL queries related to managing a music store. The database includes tables for customers, artists, items (music albums), employees, orders, and order details. The project aims to demonstrate proficiency in SQL database management, querying, and manipulation.

## SQL Queries

The project contains a series of SQL queries that demonstrate various operations and functionalities of the database:

Retrieving customer names and phone numbers sorted by last name and first name.
Displaying customer names, phone numbers, and fax numbers for customers from specific states.
Listing unique city names where customers reside.
Calculating and displaying sale prices for items with a 25% discount.
Showing customer names and phone numbers for customers with zip codes starting with '4'.
Filtering orders made between specific date ranges and displaying them with formatted order dates.
Displaying orders made on Saturdays and Sundays along with their order dates.
Retrieving customer names and phone numbers for customers who have fax numbers.
Inserting a new item record into the "items" table.
Updating the unit price of a specific item.
Deleting a specific item from the "items" table.
Combining customer last names, first names, and formatting phone numbers in a specific style.

## Usage
You can explore and use this repository to understand SQL database management, querying techniques, and database manipulation. 

# Project 3: Excel Project

## Description: 

This project shows a dataset of a bike business that contains different information about customers. The data set was used to determine the demographics of those who decided to buy a bike. The reason for the analysis was to understand the target segments the company should focus in the market.

## Data Preprocessing

The data used M and S for marital status and F and M for gender which were changed in order to increase readability. Duplicate values were dropped in order to prevent the skewing of our data set. Bins were created for age groups in order to make it easier for the viewer to understand the charts that were created.

## Pivot Tables and Charts

Pivot Tables were used to explore different demographics such as gender, commute distance, age and car ownership. Charts were then created to visualize the data.

## Dashboard

The charts that were generated from the pivot tables were used in the dashboard. Slicers were added on the side to give the user more options when interpreting the data.
